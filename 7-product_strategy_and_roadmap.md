![Google Cloud Platform Blog](GCPBlog.png)

Follow the [Google Cloud Platform Blog](googlecloudplatform.blogspot.no/) for product updates. Recently a [proposal for Google Cloud Dataflow to join the open source Apache Incubator](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.no/2016/01/Dataflow-and-open-source-proposal-to-join-the-Apache-Incubator.html) was published.

The individual services publish [release notes](https://cloud.google.com/s/results?q=release%20notes) indicating new features and bug fixes. A couple examples:
* [BigQuery Release Notes](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/release-notes).
* [Prediction API Release Notes](https://cloud.google.com/prediction/docs/release_notes).
