# Commercial model proposed

You only pay for what you use in the Google Cloud Platform, as outlined in the next chapter. No prepaid product or service procurement is necessary. Sustained use discounts automatically save you money when you use instances for more than 25% of the month, as described in the [Pricing Philosophy](https://cloud.google.com/pricing/philosophy/).

Bekk Consulting and NTA has successfully worked together on several modernization initiatives for some years. For this proposal, Bekk Consulting suggests that NTA uses a similar model: Teams of NTA domain experts combined with with external expertise for project management, design and development on the Google Cloud Platform. 

Bekk Consulting can be the cloud integrator for the NTA, establishing a DevOps team taking full responsibility of solution administration and maintenance, on-call operations and  monitoring, incident management and pager duty.
